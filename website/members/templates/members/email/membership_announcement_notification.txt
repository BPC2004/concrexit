Dear board,

It's that time of the year again! The website sent an automatic email to
all members that have a study membership.

That email tells them that their membership is valid as long as they're enrolled
in either a Computing Science or an Information Sciences programme.
We asked them to notify you when they graduate or stop with their studies for any
other reason so that you'll be able to update the administration.

This means that you can expect an influx of emails from members.

The email was sent to:
{% for member in members %}
 * {{ member.get_full_name }}
{% endfor %}

Kisses,

The website
