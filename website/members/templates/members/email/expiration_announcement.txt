{% load i18n %}{% blocktrans %}Dear {{ name }},

The past year you've been a member or benificiary of Study Association Thalia.
You've not given us permission to prolong it automatically, thus your membership will
end on the 1st of September.

If you still want to enjoy all the benefits a membership gives you the coming year
then you'll have to renew it. This'll give you access to activities, the book sale,
our exam collection and a symposium. Come by the board room and we'll help you
to extend your membership.

Are you not able to come by? Then just send us an email: info@thalia.nu.

With kind regards,

The board of Study Association Thalia
